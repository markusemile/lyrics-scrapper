Adventure of a Lifetime
[Intro]
[Indecipherable]
[Verse 1]
"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel
[Chorus]
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
[Verse 2]
Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"
